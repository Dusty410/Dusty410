I'm David, currently a student working towards an Associate's in Computer Information Systems and hoping to graduate Fall 2023. I've taken classes in Python, VB.net, SQL, C, C++, HTML, and PHP, and this semester doing a co-op and continuing in web dev. This repository has some of my class projects and fun things I've done on the side. There's always more to learn!
